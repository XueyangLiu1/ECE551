In this short assignment, you will add constructors to the Vector2D
class you previously defined. 

Your only task is to modify your class in vector.hpp and vector.cpp to
have two different constructors, described below. Make sure you use an
initializer list.
  1.  Copy your vector.hpp and vector.cpp files to this directory.
  2.  Define the default constructor, which should initialize both x and y to 0.
  3.  Define a constructor that takes in two arguments representing
      the x and y coordinates of the vector and initializes x and y.

You may remove initVector, as you will no longer need it.
