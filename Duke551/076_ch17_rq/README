As always, read and understand Chapter 17, then answer these questions
in "answers.txt". 

1.  Templates are an example of which of the following?
    A.  Static variables
    B.  POD types
    C.  Parametric polymorphism
    D.  An exception to the Rule of Three

2.  For which of the following may the compiler infer template
    parameters during instantiation? 
    A.  Templated classes and templated functions
    B.  Templated classes only
    C.  Templated functions only
    D.  None of the above

3.  What is the difference betweeen template<typename T> and
    template<class T>? 
    A.  The former allows any type to be passed as the parameter--the
        latter only classes.
    B.  The former allows any type to be passed as the parameter--the
        latter, only classes or structs.
    C.  The former allows any type to be passed as the parameter--the
        later only non-POD types.
    D.  None of the above

4.  In a templated class, what is the scope of the template parameters?
    A.  The field declarations
    B.  Anywhere the visibility specifier is private
    C.  The entire class
    D.  Until the end of the file in which it is declared

5.  Suppose you have 
      template<typename T>
      class X {
        T v1;
        T::t v2;
        Y<T> v3;
        Y<T>::z v4;
      };
    This attempt to declare templated class X is incorrect as it is
    missing "typename" before the type names which are dependent
    names. Which variables' declarations require "typename"?
    A.  Only v1
    B.  Only v2
    C.  Only v3
    D.  v1 and v2
    E.  v1 and v3
    F.  v1 and v4
    G.  v2 and v3
    H.  v2 and v4
    I.  v3 and v4
    J.  v1, v2, and v3
    K.  v1, v2, and v4
    L.  v2, v3, and v4
    M.  All four variables (v1, v2, v3, and v4)

6.  When is the body of a templated function or class type checked?
    A.  When the compiler encounters the declaration of the template
    B.  When the compiler has type checked all other code in the
        compilation unit
    C.  When the template is specialized for the first time
    D.  When a new template specialization is created

7.  The fact that std::vector<T> can overload operator== and
    operator<, even though not all possible "T"s themselves have ==
    and/or < defined on them is a great example of which template rule
    in action? 
    A.  Dependent type names require the "typename" keyword.
    B.  Templates are typechecked when they are specialized.
    C.  Template declarations must be visible at the point of
        specialization. 
    D.  Multiple close brackets must be separated by whitespace.

8.  Iterators are a great examples of which of the following?
    A.  The Rule of Three
    B.  Dependent name resolution
    C.  Implicit conversions
    D.  Abstraction

9.  When a programmer says "arbitrary" (as in "insert into a data
    structure at an arbitrary position"), what does she mean? 
    A.  It does not matter
    B.  Random
    C.  Any one that you might choose
    D.  Irrational

10. What is the difference in the * operator between an iterator and
    a const_iterator? 
    A.  In an iterator, the * operator returns a pointer to the
        element, while the const_iterator returns elements by value.
    B.  In an iterator, the * operator returns a reference, while the
        const_iterator returns a const reference.
    C.  In the iterator, the * operator returns a reference to the
        element, while the const_iteartor returns elements by value.
    D.  None of the above

11. How do you know if some operation invalidates a particular iterator on 
    some data structure?
    A.  Operations that delete from a data structure invalidate all of
        its iterators (and only deletion operations invalidate
        iterators). 
    B.  Any operations that modify the contents of a data structure
        invalidate all of its iterators.
    C.  When an operation modifies a data structure, any iterator that
        references the affected position(s) is invalidated.
    D.  None of the above
