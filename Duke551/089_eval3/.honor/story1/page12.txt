#toaster Grew
After thinking about it for a bit, you decide to go to Grew for help. When
you explain your quest, and that you have a magic toaster, Grew gets an
idea. 

"Well, dragons really love to eat, so lets just give them a better option
than the animals in the area!" Grew exclaims. He goes on to explain how you
will create the best all-you-can-eat brunch buffet ever. Grew will arrange
for berries, smoked salmon, pastries, and you will provide literally
all-you-can-eat toast with the magic toaster. 

You swing by Troll Foods, the local grocery store (yes, run by real
trolls--but they are nice trolls) and pick up the supplies: 10 kg of smoked
salmon, 20 kg of mixed berries, and 100 pastries.

Upon arriving at the dragon's cave, you lay out the buffet and start making
toast. The dragon is so happy with the food, and thrilled that he can make
all the toast he wants, that he agrees to stop eating people's farm
animals, on one condition: you and Grew have to come back each week and
have brunch with him.

You all live happily ever after.
