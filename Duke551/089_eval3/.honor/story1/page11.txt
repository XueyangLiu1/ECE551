#toaster Denevieve
After thinking about it for a bit, you decide that Denevieve is the better
choice. You go to her house and explain your quest. 

"Why don't we make some mimosas to go with the toast, and take them to the
dragon? That would surely placate him," she suggests. 

You agree that mimosas are a great idea. Of course, it seems like you
should probably make quite a lot of mimosas for a dragon. The two of you
set off to the local grocery store, Troll Foods (yes, run by real
trolls--but they are nice) and acquire supplies. You decide on 20 liters of
orange juice and 20 liters of sparkling wine.

You take the supplies back to your house and start making mimosas. As you
do this, you remember the most important thing you learned in Denevieve's
class: testing is important. The first mimosa is great, but you remember
that one test case is not enough. After 10 mimosas worth of test cases, you
are very sure that they are good, but also that you are really drunk. 

You take your remaining mimosas to the dragon's cave and call out to him 

"Hey dagron. I've gotss some drinkss and toasht for you."

The dragon slithers out of his cave intrigued by your offer. As you go to
make toast, you realize you are too drunk to operate your magic toaster. 

The dragon eats you instead, while sipping on a mimosa.

You have been eaten by a dragon.
