#whistle, Denevieve
After thinking about it a bit, you decide that Denevieve is probably a
better choice. After all, her singing skills are likely to come in handy,
especially with your magic whistle. Maybe dragons can be tamed by choir
music and bird calls? That could be right, but you aren't sure--you slept
through that day of Magical Creature Biology class. 

After knocking on the door, Denevieve is surprised to hear about the dragon
threat but is happy to help you. After all, you were her best student and
tested every piece of code extensively and incrementally. Surely you can be
trusted with a quest about dragons.

The two of you set off into the hills and find the cave of the dragon. You
take a minute to confer about your musical options and come up with a short
list of three possible combinations to tame the dragon.
