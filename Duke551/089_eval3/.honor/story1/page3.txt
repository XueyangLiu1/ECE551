#shoes
As you take the magic shoes from the wizard's hand, he disappears in a puff
of smoke. You decide that you should give the shoes a try before you set
off to deal with the dragon (after all, if you learned nothing else in
school, it was that testing is VERY important). 

You put on the shoes and start jumping all over the village. As you bound
over fences and onto the roofs of small houses, your fellow villagers look
at you in awe. You are sure you could win any basketball game but are a
little more worried about how you will deal with a dragon.

Putting that question in the back of your mind, you contemplate whether or
not you should get some help before you set out. On the one hand, if you go
alone, you might be able to better sneak into the dragon's lair. On the
other hand, help might be useful.

Fortunately for you, the two wisest people you know, Denevieve and Grew,
live in the next village over. Thinking about it for several minutes, you
decide whom to go to for help.
