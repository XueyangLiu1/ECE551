#angels we have heard on high
You take out your whistle and Denevieve starts to sing

"Angels we have heard on high" (COCKADOODLEDO)
"Sweetly singing o'er the plains" (COCKADOODLEDO).
"And the mountains in reply" (COCKADOODLEDO).
"Echoing their joyous strains" (COCKADOODLEDO).

As Denevieve sings and you make bird calls, the dragon comes out of his
cave looking quite angry. 

"WHO DARES DISTURB MY SLUMBER... Oh hello. You look tasty."

The dragon eats you.
