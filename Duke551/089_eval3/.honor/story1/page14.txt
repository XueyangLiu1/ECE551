LOSE
#silent night
You take out your whistle and Denevieve starts to sing

"Si--iii-lent niiight" (CAW CAW CAW)
"Ho--oly night" (CAW CAW).
"Aaaalll iiss calm aaaalll is bright" (CAW CAW).

As Denevieve sings and you make bird calls, the dragon comes out of his
cave looking quite angry. 

"WHO DARES DISTURB MY SLUMBER... Oh hello. You look tasty."

The dragon eats you.
