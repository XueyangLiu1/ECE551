LOSE
#whistle, Grew
After thinking about it for a bit, you decide that Grew is the best
choice. You go to visit him, and explain your plan: Grew will make some
cinnamon almond cupcakes with dark chocolate ganache, and you will seranade
the dragon with your bird calls. Together, you will put the dragon in such
a good mood that you can befriend him and convince him to leave your
villages alone. 

Sadly, while the dragon does find the cupcakes delicious, he wants
something else to go with them. 

You have been eaten by a dragon.
