#shoes, Denevieve
After thinking about it for a bit, you decide Denevieve is a better
choice. After all she teaches undergraduate Dynamics, so surely that can
help you fight a dragon? 

After you explain your quest and demonstrate your magic shoes, Denevieve
pulls out a whiteboard and explains how to make it work: 

"First, we need to model the dragon as a rigid body and your magic shoes as
a point mass. Then we apply Lagrangeâ€™s Equations and... hmm this would be
much easier if the dragon's cave were a frictionless surface, but we
probably can't assume that, so instead (she writes big complicated equation
and does a bunch of calculus)... Ok, you need to jump right here on the top
of the dragon's head." She says, indicating a point on the dragon's head in
her free-body diagram. 

The two of you set off to the dragon's cave, and you carefully jump at
exactly the right place while Denevieve distracts the dragon with a lecture
about Coulomb friction. Your mighty jump knocks the dragon
unconscious. While the dragon is passed out, you tie him up.

When the dragon wakes up, you work out an agreement where the dragon will
learn C++ programming and earn his food by writing software instead of
stealing it. 

Everyone lives happily ever after.
