LOSE
# shoes, grew
After thinking about it for a bit, you decide to go to Grew for help. Grew
thinks about your problem for a while, and the best idea he can come up
with is to challenge the dragon to a game of basketball. After all, you do
have magic shoes that would let you dunk quite easily. 

The two of you set off to the dragon's cave, and the dragon agrees to your
challenge. Unfortunately, even being able to jump 10 feet in the air, the
dragon, who is 20 feet tall and can fly, can still block all your shots and
dunk over your head. The dragon wins the game and eats both you and Grew.

You have been eaten by a dragon.
