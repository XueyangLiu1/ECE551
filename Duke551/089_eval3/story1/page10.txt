LOSE
#angels we have heard on high
You take out your whistle and Denevieve starts to sing

"Mama, just killed a man"
"Put a gun against his head"
"Pulled my trigger, now he's dead"
"Mama, life had just begun"
"But now I've gone and thrown it all away"

As Denevieve sings and you make bird calls, the dragon comes out of his
cave looking quite amused. He sings along with you all for a while, but
when you hit "Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth"

the dragon roars "INDEED YOU DO! AND THE TRUTH IS YOU LOOK TASTY!"

The dragon eats you.
