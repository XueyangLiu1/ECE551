#toaster
As you take the magic toaster from the wizard's hand, he disappears in a
puff of smoke. You decide that you should give the toaster a try before you
set off to deal with the dragon (after all, if you learned nothing else in
school, it was that testing is VERY important). 

Having not had any breakfast, you are quite hungry, so testing the toaster
seems like a great solution to two problems. You grab a rock off the
ground, stuff it in, and think of delicious toast with raspberry jam. A few
seconds later, out pops the most perfectly done toast with just the right
amount of butter and jam. Wow that is good! You spend a while longer
testing the toaster again and again "just to be sure". After you are
stuffed on toast, you start to wonder how this will help you with the
dragon. 

Putting that question in the back of your mind, you contemplate whether or
not you should get some help before you set out. On the one hand, if you go
alone, you might be able to better sneak into the dragon's lair. On the
other hand, help might be useful.

Fortunately for you, the two wisest people you know, Denevieve and Grew,
live in the next village over. Thinking about it for several minutes, you
decide whom to go to for help.
