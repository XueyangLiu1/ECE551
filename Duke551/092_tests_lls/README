For this assignment, you will be writing test cases for your next
assignment.  As usual, the instructions for the next assignment are
in next-README.

For this assignment, you will be writing test cases (in a file called
test-lls.cpp) for an integer linked list class with the methods
given in il.h.  While the next assignment is writing a templated
linked list class, you will only write test cases for the IntList
class for now.  By now, you should be quite familiar with the idea
of writing test cases first.

We have created compiled object files (in
/usr/local/ece551/lls/ where il.o is correct, and the files with a
number for 'X' in ilX.o files are each broken in some way).

We have provided a run_all.sh script, which will compile your
test-lls.cpp with each object file, run your tests, and report if
your tests failed each broken implementation (and passed the correct
one).

In il.h, you will see a function testList, which is a friends of
IntList, which you may define in test-lls.cpp to access private
members of IntList in your testing.

Submit your test-lls.cpp file when you are done.
